Some time ago, I have found that my personal website began to be a little outdated and I wanted to refactor it to lay ground for **new experiments**. 👨‍🔬

One of these experiments was to start a **personal blog**, a place where I could freely write and mostly, deepen some things that I want to know or to remember better. And, if my thoughts can benefit other people around the world, it would be a nice add-on. ✨

I can add **bold**, *italics*, `code`, [link](https://objective-mirzakhani-320270.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/blog/new),
